### Recommended tools to build software in the Java ecosystem

- Version Control: git
- Build system: Gradle
- Language flavour: Kotlin

@fa[arrow-down]
+++

#### Gradle

Gradle is a build and dependency management system.

- Easy to understand
+++?code=src/build.gradle&lang=groovy$title=build.gradle
@[1,1] (Build Java)
@[3-9] (Build jar)
@[11-13] (Repository central)
@[15-17] (Dependencies)

+++

#### Gradle
- Programable / Extensible

@fa[arrow-down]
+++

#### Gradle
- Fast

## Development

The Java Framework of choice is Spring Boot.
 - Autoconfiguration
+++?code=src/java/SampleApplication.java&lang=java&title=Application Class
@[3] Spring Application annotation

+++?code=src/java/controller/SampleController.java
@[3,12,17] (Controller annotations)

+++
## Development

Database "migrations" using [Flyway](https://www.flyway.com)

+++?code=src/database/V1__create_table_sample.sql&lang=sql&title=Migrations file.

Run the migrations file
```
flyway -url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/my_database" -locations=filesystem:databases/migrations clean migrate
```

## Managing the Application's connections
Applications often need to get/receive data from other services.
An app needs to be able to answer the following questions:
- What are the hosts I need to connect to?
- How do other services connect with me?
- What happens if the server I need data form is down?
- How do I authenticate my requests?
- Where is the app config?

### Service discovery
Difficult to hand-configure service clients in the cloud.

### Service discovery
Service discovery pattern where the application will request the Service Registry the host/s for the service it needs to connect to.

### Service Discovery
Service Registry for Pivotal Cloud Foundry is based on Eureka, Netflixâ€™s Service Discovery server and client.
